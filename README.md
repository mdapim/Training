# TypeScript & Fastify CheatSheet

## Description
I find the best way to learn is to physically get involved, these are tutorials from youtube that I had used to learn the basics. 
This cheatsheet is a good knowledge point to come back to when revisiting or working on new projects

## What I learnt
- The basic types used in typescript and examples of when it's best to use them
- How to set up a basic fastify server and endpoints.
- Setting up Routes and Controllers to make the code cleaner and more readable
- Serialising and validating requests
